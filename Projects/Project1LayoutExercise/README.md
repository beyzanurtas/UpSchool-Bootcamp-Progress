After the resource file in the [given link](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/4762-design-courses-app-sketch-freebie-resource.html) was uploaded to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/?fuid=), we tried to make designs that could be close to these designs. Since the dimensions and positions in the original project did not give the expected result in terms of user experience when we ran it on the emulator and device, we had to make changes to these values. 

### *Original Design*

### *Bonus Page*
- This page was not included in the design we had to do, but I did not want the *Sign up* text on the Start page to be blank, so I added this page as an exercise as a bonus.
